However, what makes R especially powerful is the framework it provides for allowing users to openly create and distribute custom packages. Because of this, thousands of open-source R packages are available for just about any common data science task. But packages can contain functions for anything, seriously anything, check this link out if you need to get your creative juices flowing: https://rpubs.com/dbecker7/StrangeRThings\n",

What this means is that when a person runs: `library(your_cool_package)` their search path should not be updated with anything but the package itself (i.e. no other packages are added). This is important as whenever packages are added to the search path they bring in new objects and if those objects mask something currently in the envrionment they may uninentionally disrupt the environment. Basically, if whenever your package is attached and it causes `ggplot2` to also be added you're changing their envrionment likely without their knowledge -- don't do that!\n",

    "* To the function that calls the c++ script, add the `roxygen2` tag: `#' @useDynLib <package_name>` \n",
    "* Lastly, In the DESCRIPTION file, add the line: `LinkingTo: Rcpp`. There is likely an automated way to do this, but I've found it simple enough to manually add it.\n",
